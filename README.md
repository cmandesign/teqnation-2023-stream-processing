## Teqnation 2023: Apache Beam VS Spring Boot & Redis

## Overview
This repository contains the implementations of a project created for the Teqnation 2023 conference. The project involves consuming customer data events and order events, enriching these two together, and then publishing the enriched output as a message to a pubsub topic.

Two solutions were created for comparison, one utilizing Apache Beam, and the other Spring Boot along with Redis.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories, each containing the respective solution:

- `beam-enrichment`: Contains the implementation using Apache Beam.
- `spring-boot`: Contains the implementation using Spring Boot and Redis.
